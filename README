		<p>
			Dynomenu is a CSS3 based dropdown menu as coded by Red here: <a href="http://www.red-team-design.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/css3-dropdown-menu-demo.html">http://www.red-team-design.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/css3-dropdown-menu-demo.html</a>. 
			The twist that drove the plugin is that it will adjust the contents of the menu based on the width of the menu and its contents - it will make the font smaller and/or extend the menu via a 'more' link.
